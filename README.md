# IBM-Data-Analysis-with-Python
This will take from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data and learned how to analyze data using Python. We will learned how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

Topics covered:

1) Importing Datasets
2) Cleaning the Data
3) Data frame manipulation
4) Summarizing the Data
5) Building machine learning Regression models
6) Building data pipelines

Data Analysis with Python includes following parts:

Data Analysis libraries: will learned to use Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset. We will be introduced to pandas, an open-source library, and use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Then we will introduced to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
